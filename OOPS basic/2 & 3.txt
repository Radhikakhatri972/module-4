Q2. What is OOP? List OOP concepts;

--> It is Object Oriented programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that focuses on 
the use of object to represent and manipulate data.In OOP,data is encapsulated within 
object,and objects are defined by their properties(attributes)and behaviors(methods).
OOP provides several key concepts that enable developers to write modular,reusable,and 
maintainable code.

OOP concepts lists are: 

* Class
* Object
* Data Abstraction
* Encapsulation
* Inheritance
* Polymorphism
* Dynamic Binding
* Message Passing


Q3. What is the difference between OOP and POP?;

-->The diffrence between OOP and POP is that OOP standfor Object-Oriented Peograming,
and POP stands for proceduew-Oriented Programing.OOP is a paradigm that uses objects 
and classes to desig and implement software application,while pop is a paradigm that 
uses procedures or functions to perform tasks.

some of the key diffrence between OOP and POP are:

* OOP follows abottom-up approach,while POP followsa top-down approch.
* OOP supports inheritance,polymorphism,abstracton,and encapsulation,while POP does not 
  support these features.
* OOP provides access control to data and methods through access modifiers,while pop
  does not have ana access control mechanism.
* OOP facilitates code reusability and modularity,while POP leads to code duplication 
  and complexity.
